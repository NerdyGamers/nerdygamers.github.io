                <h3 class="icefont about-text">NerdyGamers was created with a single mission.... The production of Game Plugins/Scripts, Host Free to Play Servers, and to collect a variety of Programs and Resources to be able to successfully create the Plugins/Scripts you desire to be used by everyone. Our Unturned plugins are written RocketMod, Rust Plugins use the Oxide code, and the Ultima Online Scripts were Created and Tested using the ServUO Server Platform. All of our Plugins/Scripts are free. The majority of the Plugins and Scripts on this were created by a couple dudes named <a href="https://www.servuo.com/members/espcevan.1225/">JBob</a> and <a href="https://www.servuo.com/members/emtguy89.712/">Ragnarok</a>. This website is also maintained by the same nerds.</h3>
                <h2>If you would like to contribute to development, please check out our <a href="https://github.com/NerdyGamers">GitHub</a>. If you would like to buy the peoples named JBob and Ragnarok something nice, donate <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net/">Here</a>.</h2>
